# Working with backtesting.py library
The file [`error_example.ipynb`](error_example.ipynb) was meant as a demonstration to show a glitch/bug with plotting and downsampling. There are two environment files. One is my environment that I use regularly. The other is a brand new enviroment with just backtesting.py and scikit-optimize installed. 
Both environments cause the same error.

[`backtesting_exit_strategies.ipyng`]((backtesting_exit_strategies.ipynb)) is a notebook for working with losing positions and algorithmically solving for a position sizing approach to average down into losing trades. It is a WIP.
